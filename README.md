## Troubleshooting

**Page not found**

Probably an error in the hosts file. Make sure the domain is correct. The following is done on a Mac. Edit the hosts file:

```sudo nano /private/etc/hosts``` (navigate file with arrow keys)

Add ```192.168.100.119	vm-dev.com```

```ctrl+o``` (saves the file)

```ctrl+x``` (exits the editor)

**PHP errors when loading domain**

Refresh the browser.

**Apache default page**

If you are suddenly seeing a default apache ubuntu page instead of the website, this will most likely fix it:

From the root folder of the repo:

```vagrant status``` - Make sure the vagrant is up and running

```vagrant ssh```

```sudo a2dissite 000-default```

```sudo service apache2 restart```
